# Programming_For_Linguists
This repo just contains a short introductory stuff on Programming.

## This is a *Work-In-Progress* 

- Using Emacs Org-mode for the Sprinkled Code Examples
- Using Clojure as a Tool for Thought

## WHY Clojure?

Because I really felt that I need to make a language my own, 
- be able to think in a language
- deconstruct any problem in terms of this language
- be able to explore the problem at whim

I know that there's Python, there's Haskell and there's Perl but to my mind there's no better mother tongue than LISP. 
And Clojure with it's Java heritage and JavaScript horizon is the one for me.

`" LISP is not a language, it's building material " - Alan Kay`

## WHY Linguistics?

Because there's a lot I don't understand about Programming and Human-Languages! To me these, the Art of Thinking and Problem Solving is 
deeply intertwined _and_ simplified in LISP and Linguistics. Plus, I just understand Algorithms and Ideas better with Creative Contexts and Stories so this is an attempt to document and to share that journey of mine.
